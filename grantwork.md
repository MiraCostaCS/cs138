See [About]({{ site.baseurl }}/about) page to see overview of grant project and methodology.

_Note: all documents below are shared for transparency of a collaborative process between CS student interns and faculty through multi-semester development. Finalized versions will be shared through a Canvas shell and resource document once the phases below are completed._

## Planning

Below are the planning materials generated in Spring 2024:

- IDEA OER Assessment Rubrics: thinkcspy, Python for Everybody, Composing Programs, Python Coding Cookbook, Python Docs
  - [Inheritance](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AfVOUIk1CYbxDsIXFJVDTNrVkIwC9Fm-tWHcSuwKSxU/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [Lists and Dictionaries](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eZ-Uqn2h_qwYpFO-xR6pekr9T_JfhNr1tg0HVjLLOSw/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [Exception Handling](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eNwTG2W440Pc7xFyslgOiDmnTffdNEpK1apxJpad_q8/edit?usp=sharing)
- IDE/Platform Research: Replit no longer an option, explored [CodeHS](https://codehs.com/) and [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- [Lab + Discussion Post Brainstorming](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/193aQqEYcAw8CuuXU1deYpJYzWN_eNVjqC1AkklMhtNk/edit?usp=sharing): Assessing current assignments and identifying areas of growth

## Implementing

Below are the materials built in Fall 2024 and Spring 2025:

- IDE Selection: using CodeHS primarily because it allows for easier testing, use Google Colab for certain labs with more setup/warmup activities
- Canvas Sandbox: working off of [GOALS in CS](https://miracostacs.github.io/curriculum.html) canvas shells with OER/ZTC Instructional Designer
- Discussion Posts:
  - [Native/Indigenous Tribes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kjzEwAlF618eXTiId6djGS31G1vqy-n9wERBXZ4etBQ/edit?usp=sharing)
