# CS138 - Programming with Python

This is the course materials website for CS138 at MiraCosta College, built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) on GitHub Pages and the [HydeOut](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) theme. You can refer to those porojects on how to use, develop, test, and run this site in more detail.

### Quick Use

Note the below usage assumes things are setup and working, running in terminal for macOS:

Run jekyll server in live reload mode on port 4002, in project directory run:
`bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload --livereload_port 4003 --port 4002`

You can go to `http://localhost:4002/cs138/` in your browser now and see the site. Any changes (except to the `_config.yml`) file will be auto-reloaded in the webpage.

Note: a port is specified in case you run another instance of jekyll at the same time (i.e. to test main site or other course at the same time)
